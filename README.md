## What is the RenewBench Crawler Repository?

This RenewBench repository contains code to download and process all data that is part of the RenewBench
dataset. This code is available in the RenewBench Crawlers `rcb` python package, and we also include example
configuration files and scripts to run the downloads.

## Installation
We heavily recommend installing the `rcb`package in a dedicated `Python3.11+` virtual environment. You can
install ``rcp`` directly from the GitHub repository via:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/RenewBench-Association/RenewBench-Crawler
```
Alternatively, you can install ``rcb`` locally. To achieve this, there are two steps you need to follow:
1. Clone the RenewBench-Crawler repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RenewBench-Association/RenewBench-Crawler
   ```
2. Install the package from the main branch. There are multiple installation options available:
   - Install basic dependencies: ``pip install .``
   - Install an editable version with developer dependencies: ``pip install -e ."[dev]"``

## Structure
The RenewBench-Crawlers repository is structured as shown below:
